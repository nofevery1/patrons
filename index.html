      <p>We'd like to thank the following individuals for their patronage to Reader through Kickstarter. Their support - at such a critical stage of funding - helps us make the intersection of science publishing and modern web technology a reality, along with our future goals for innovating in the communication of science.</p>

Move, eat, cogitate, engage, sleep. Tune these; do better; be more brilliant it's a guaranteed side effect when the brain & (rest of the) body work together (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/wellthcog">tinyurl.com/wellthcog</a>). That's it. How to tune those in-bodied 5 elements? That's where Reader and access to science/engineering info is key: explore idea spaces, share insights, engage in crafting & testing new ideas.

Therefore traditional science reading is time consuming both for research and medicine. Reader is a refreshing initiative, changing the course of publications itself would be the next step ;-)</p>
